#  The LexisML Viewer  #

The LexisML Viewer provides web rendering support for LexisML pages.
Simply replace [index.xml](index.xml) with a LexisML lexis file and open [index.xhtml](index.xhtml) in your web browser.
Alternatively, include [script.js](script.js) in the `<head>` of an html file in the same directory as an `index.xml` lexis file; note that any contents of the file will be removed.
