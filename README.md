#  LexisML  #

LexisML is a markup syntax and collection of related tools for recording the lexicons and grammatical structures of languages.
It is currently being standardized through the publication of several LexisML Standards Documents (LSDOCs); see the gh-pages branch for more information.

This branch provides tools and algorithms for processing and handling the formats outlined through the various LexisML standards.
The current LexisML Viewer, built to process LexisML 2.0, is available in the `viewer` branch.
LexisML 2.0 was never standardized, but you can see examples of its use in the `sample-lexis.xml` and `sample-word.xml` files.
LexisML 2.0 will eventually be superseded by LexisML Index Records (LRECs) and an as-yet unspecified lexeme record system.
