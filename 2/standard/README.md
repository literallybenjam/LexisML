#  LexisML 2  #

This document defines the second version of LexisML, a markup language for recording the lexicons of languages.
This is the first version to have a complete standard.

LexisML 2 was developed by [Benjamin Russel Shoemake][BENJAM] for use with [the langdev project][LANGDEV].
The specification was written in [Markdown][MARKDOWN] and published to GitHub at <https://github.com/literallybenjam/LexisML/2>.
A version history can be found there.
If you wish to get involved in the LexisML project, reach out to the langdev team [on twitter][LANGDEVTWEETS] or [through GitHub][LANGDEV].

__The LexisML 2 specification is still very much under development and should be consulted with care.__
