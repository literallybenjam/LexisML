#  LexisML 2.0  #

LexisML 2.0 is an attempt to document and standardize the XML that was hacked together in LexisML 1.0, as well as develop tools for the processing and display of this information.

The standard for LexisML is currently __in active development__; you can view it [here](standard).

**
This version is OUTDATED; LexisML has been completely revamped but the standard has not yet been written.
You can check out the [sample-lexis.xml](sample-lexis.xml) and [sample-word.xml](sample-word.xml) files for examples of the new syntax.
