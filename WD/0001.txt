LANGDEV          WD-0001 : LEXISML STANDARDS DOCUMENTS              002


01.     Introduction

    The LexisML Standards Document (LSDOC) provides information
    relating to current standards and best-practices in the development
    and deployment of LexisML, a markup syntax and collection of
    related tools for recording the lexicons and other grammatical
    information of languages. This document provides the syntax and
    file format for all future LSDOCs, until such a time as this
    standard is superseded.

    The canonical representation of an LSDOC is a UTF-8--encoded plain
    text file. This ensures consistent representation and readability
    on virtually any platform. The specific requirements for the proper
    formatting of these text files are listed in §02.

    This document also presents a number of style suggestions for the
    composition of LSDOCs. Although these need not be followed
    strictly, deviations should not be made without good reason. Where
    style suggestions are not specified, this document encourages
    general adherance with the latest version of the Chicago Manual of
    Style.

    01-A.   Definitions

        Begin : Of a sequence of lines or characters, to be first in an
            sequence's contents.

        Blank line : A line which contains zero characters; that is,
            a single U+000A LINE FEED.

        Centered : Of a sequence of lines, having every line preceeded
            by (71-L)/2 U+0020 SPACE characters, rounded down, where L
            is the number of characters in the line's contents.

        Character : When not qualified as a Unicode character, a
            graphic character, as defined in [UNICODE].

        Contents : Of a line, the sequence of zero or more characters
            which comprise the line. Of a page, lines 05--45 of the
            page. Of an LSDOC, the contents of each of its pages. Of a
            section, the sequence of lines which comprise the section,
            not including the section heading. Of another sequence, the
            sequence itself. A sequence of characters or lines is said
            to be "contained" in another sequence if it is in the
            sequence's contents.

        Document identifier : A sequence of seven characters as defined
            in §02-B.

        End : Of a sequence of characters, to be last in an sequence's
            contents. Of a sequence of lines, to be the last lines in
            an sequence's contents which are not blank.

        Indented : Of a line, starting with some number of U+0020 SPACE
            characters. When used as "indented from" some line X, the
            first non-space character of the line must be preceeded by
            four more U+0020 SPACE characters than the first non-space
            character of X.

        Indented contents : The contents of a line, starting with the
            first non-space character in the line.

        Initial line : The line which begins a sequence.

        Line : A sequence of zero or more characters terminated by
            U+000A LINE FEED.

        List : A sequence of one or more list items. List items MAY be
            separated by blank lines.

        List item : A sequence of lines, as defined in §02-F.

        LSDOC : A file which conforms to this specification.

        Non-initial line : A line which does not begin a sequence.

        Non-space character : A character which is not U+0020 SPACE.

        Numbered section heading : A section heading, as defined in
            §02-D.

        Page : A sequence of lines, as defined in §02-A.

        Paragraph : A sequence of lines, as defined in §02-E.

        Section : A sequence of lines, as defined in §02-D. The first
            line of a section heading SHOULD be the first line in a
            section.

        Section heading : One or more lines as defined in §02-D. A
            section heading is described as "describing" a section if
            the first line of the section heading is the first line of
            the section.

        Sentence case : Capitalized according to standard conventions
            for sentences, such as those laid out in §??.

        Sibling : Of a subsection, contained in exactly the same
            sections as another. Sections which are not subsections are
            also considered siblings of each other.

        Subsection : A section which is contained by another section.

        Title case : Capitalized according to standard conventions for
            titles, such as those laid out in §??.

        Unicode character : A Unicode scalar value, as defined in
            [UNICODE].

        Unnumbered section heading : A section heading which is not a
            numbered section heading.

        Uppercase : Containing only upperchase characters, as defined
            in [UNICODE].

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
        "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in [RFC 2119].



02.     Format Rules

    LSDOCs are plain text files, encoded in UTF-8.


    02-A.   Pages

        LSDOCs are made up of one or more pages conforming to the
        following requirements:

        -   Each page MUST be exactly 50 lines long.

        -   Each line of a page MUST contain no more than 71
            characters, followed by U+000A LINE FEED. This makes the
            maximum length of a line 72 Unicode characters.

        -   U+0020 SPACE characters cannot end a line.

        -   The first line of a page MUST be blank.

        -   The second line of a page MUST contain the following
            components, in order:

            +   The author of the document, followed by U+0020 SPACE
                characters until its length exactly matches 16
                characters. Authors names longer than 16 characters
                MUST be abbreviated.

            +   A single U+0020 SPACE.

            +   The document identifier (seven characters; see §02-B).

            +   U+0020 SPACE, followed by U+003A COLON, followed by
                another U+0020 SPACE.

            +   The title of the document, followed by U+0020 SPACE
                characters until its length exactly matches 40
                characters. This SHOULD be represented in uppercase.

            +   A single U+0020 SPACE.

            +   The page number, preceeded by zeroes such that its
                length is exactly 03 characters. LSDOCs of greater than
                999 pages MUST be split into multiple documents.

        -   The third and fourth lines of a page MUST be blank.

        -   Lines 46 and 47 MUST be blank.

        -   Line 48 MUST contain the following components, in order:

            +   The document identifier (seven characters; see 02-B).

            +   Exactly 61 U+0020 SPACE characters.

            +   The page number, preceeded by zeroes such that its
                length is exactly three characters. LSDOCs of greater
                than 999 pages MUST be split into multiple documents.

        -   Line 49 MUST be blank.

        -   Line 50 MUST contain exactly 71 U+0025 PERCENT SIGN
            characters.


    02-B.   Document identifiers

    Document identifiers are 07-character codes which uniquely identify
    the LSDOC. They are constructed as follows:

        -   The first two characters indicate the current document
            status. The document statuses permitted by this document
            are:

            Working Draft (WD) : This document is currently under
                construction, and can be expected to change at any
                time.

            Release Candidate (RC) : This document is not expected to
                change significantly before final approval, but might
                contain small errors or bugs.

            Final Recommendation (FR) : This document is in its final
                form and MUST NOT undergo changes.

            Errata (E_) : This document is a formal modification to
                an LSDOC with Final Recommendation status. The
                underscore should be replaced with a letter (A--Z) to
                identify the errata. Errata MUST NOT undergo changes
                after publication; however, errata MAY modify previous
                errata. A new document SHOULD be written to supersede
                an LSDOC with a substantial number of errata.

        -   The third character MUST be U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS.

        -   Characters 04--07 MUST be digits (0--9) uniquely
            identifying the document. These MUST be unique across
            various statuses; that is, WD-0009, RC-0009, and FR-0009
            refer to different drafts of the same document, and EB-0009
            refers to FR-0009's second errata.


    02-C.   Opening contents

    An LSDOC MUST begin with the following contents, in order:

        -   A title, centred. Titles MUST NOT exceed 59 characters,
            and MUST be on their own line. Titles SHOULD be represented
            in title case.

        -   (OPTIONAL) A subtitle, centred. Subtitles SHOULD be
            represented in sentence case, with the first letter
            capitalized. Subtitles SHOULD begin on the line immediately
            following a title, and MAY take up multiple lines.

        -   The author of the document, centred. A blank line SHOULD
            be placed between the title/subtitle and the author of the
            document. Information, including contact information, MAY
            be placed on the lines immediately following the author's
            name; there SHOULD NOT be a blank line before or within any
            such content.

            Multiple authors MAY be included; there SHOULD be a blank
            line in-between each.

        -   The following sections, with unnumbered seaction headings:

            +   (OPTIONAL) An abstract.

            +   A "Status of This Document" section. This SHOULD
                contain a textual description of the document status
                designated by the document identifier (see §02-B) and
                the date of publication. Other pertinent information
                related to the status of the document may also be
                included here.

            +   A copyright notice.

            +   (RECOMMENDED) In documents with more than one numbered
                section heading, a table of contents.


    02-D.  Sections, headings, and the table of contents

        A section SHOULD be used to group together thematic content,
        and SHOULD be described by a section heading, defined below.
        The contents of a section MUST be indented from section's
        heading, if present.

        Section headings MUST describe a section. Section headings
        MAY be contained by another section, in which case they
        describe a subsection. Any sequence of lines which meets the
        requirements for section headings described in this document
        MUST be considered a section heading.

        Section headings MUST NOT contain a blank line, and non-initial
        lines in a section heading MUST be indented from the initial
        line. Section headings which do not describe subsections SHOULD
        be in title case; all other section headings SHOULD be in
        sentence case.

        Numbered section headings which are not subheadings SHOULD
        begin a page. Other section headings which do not begin a page
        SHOULD be preceeded by two blank lines. Section headings SHOULD
        be followed by a blank line.

        Sections may consist of only a section heading, but this is NOT
        RECOMMENDED.

        A numbered section heading consists of the following:

            -   A section number. This consists of:

                +   In the case of subsections, the section number of
                    the smallest section which contains the subsection,
                    followed by U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS.

                +   One or more characters in one of the following
                    ranges, equivalent to the number of preceeding
                    siblings plus one:

                    -   For sections which are not subsections, a
                        two-digit number in the range 01--99.

                    -   For subsections which are contained in exactly
                        one section, an uppercase letter in the range
                        A--Z.

                    -   For subsections which are contained in an even
                        number of sections (greater than zero), a
                        lowercase letter in the range a--z.

                    -   For subsections which are contained in an odd
                        number of sections, greater than one, a
                        single-digit number in the range 1--9.

                    If the number of preceeding siblings causes one of
                    the ranges above to be exhausted, sections SHOULD
                    be regrouped to avoid such a problem.

            -   One U+002E FULL STOP, followed by exactly three U+0020
                SPACE characters.

            -   The section title. This SHOULD NOT be ended by a U+003A
                COLON.

        An unnumbered section heading MUST end with a U+003A COLON. Any
        sequence of lines which is not a numbered section heading,
        meets the other requirements for a section heading, and is
        ended by a U+003A COLON is an unnumbered section heading.

        The table of contents for an LSDOC (see §02-C) MUST be a list
        of the contents of each numbered section heading, in order, one
        per line, with matching indentation.


    02-E.   Paragraphs

        Paragraphs SHOULD be separated from other paragraphs by a blank
        line. All lines in a paragraph SHOULD have matching
        indentation, with the exception of the first paragraph of a
        list (see §02-F). Paragraphs MAY NOT contain blank lines.

        A paragraph of quoted material SHOULD be indented from the
        surrounding text.


    02-F.   Lists

        The first line of a list item SHOULD begin with one of the
        following characters, depending on how many lists contain the
        list item in question: U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+002B PLUS SIGN,
        U+003D EQUALS SIGN, U+2021 DOUBLE DAGGER. For example, an item
        contained in only one list would use U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, but
        an item contained in a list which is contained in another list
        which is contianed in yet another list would use U+003D EQUALS
        SIGN. If this sequence of characters be exhausted, it SHOULD be
        cycled through again; for example, an item which is contained
        in six lists simultaneously would also use U+002B PLUS.

        This character SHOULD be followed by exactly three U+0020 SPACE
        characters. Non-initial lines in a list item SHOULD be indented
        from the initial line. List items MAY be preceeded or followed
        by blank lines. List items MAY contain one or more paragraphs;
        a paragraph which begins a list item should still be formatted
        according to this section. Paragraphs which do not begin a list
        item should be indented from the list item's initial line.
