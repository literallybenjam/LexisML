01.   Introduction

    The LexisML Standards Document (LSDOC) provides information
    relating to current standards and best-practices in the development
    and deployment of LexisML, a markup syntax and collection of
    related tools for recording the lexicons and other grammatical
    information of languages. This document provides the syntax and
    file format for all future LSDOCs, until such a time as this
    standard is superseded.

    The canonical representation of an LSDOC is a UTF-8--encoded plain
    text file. This ensures consistent representation and readability
    on virtually any platform. The specific requirements for the proper
    formatting of these text files are listed in §02.

    This document also presents a number of style suggestions for the
    composition of LSDOCs. Although these need not be followed
    strictly, deviations should not be made without good reason. Where
    style suggestions are not specified, this document encourages
    general adherance with the latest version of the Chicago Manual of
    Style.

    01-A.   Definitions

        Begin : Of a sequence of lines or characters, to be first in an
            sequence's contents.

        Blank line : A line which contains zero characters; that is,
            a single U+000A LINE FEED Unicode character.

        Centered : Of a sequence of lines, having every line preceeded
            by (71-L)/2 U+0020 SPACE characters, rounded down, where L
            is the number of characters in the line's contents.

        Character : When not qualified as a Unicode character, a
            graphic character, as defined in [UNICODE].

        Contents : Of a line, the sequence of zero or more characters
            which comprise the line. Of a page, lines 05--45 of the
            page. Of an LSDOC, the contents of each of its pages. Of a
            section, the sequence of lines which comprise the section,


WD-0001                                                             003

            not including the section heading. Of another sequence, the
            sequence itself. A sequence of characters or lines is said
            to be "contained" in another sequence if it is in the
            sequence's contents.

        Dictionary : A sequence of one or more dictionary items.
            Dictionary items MAY be separated by blank lines.

        Dictionary item : A sequence of lines, as defined in §02-G.

        Document identifier : A sequence of seven characters as defined
            in §02-B.

        End : Of a sequence of characters, to be last in an sequence's
            contents. Of a sequence of lines, to be the last lines in
            an sequence's contents which are not blank.

        Indented : Of a line, having some number of U+0020 SPACE
            characters begin the line. When used as "indented from"
            some line X, the first non-space character of the line MUST
            be preceeded by some number (four is RECOMMENDED) more
            U+0020 SPACE characters than the first non-space character
            of X.

        Indented contents : The contents of a line, starting with the
            first non-space character in the line.

        Initial line : The line which begins a sequence.

        Line : A sequence of zero or more characters terminated by a
            U+000A LINE FEED Unicode character.

        List : A sequence of one or more list items. List items MAY be
            separated by blank lines.

        List item : A sequence of lines, as defined in §02-F.

        LSDOC : A file which conforms to this specification.

        Page : A sequence of lines, as defined in §02-A.

        Paragraph : A sequence of lines, as defined in §02-E.

        Section : A sequence of lines, as defined in §02-D. The first
            line of a section heading SHOULD be the first line in a
            section.

        Section heading : One or more lines as defined in §02-D. A
            section heading is described as "describing" a section if

02.   Format Rules

    LSDOCs are plain text files, encoded in UTF-8.


    02-A.   Pages

        LSDOCs are made up of one or more pages conforming to the
        following requirements:

        -   Each page MUST be exactly 50 lines long.

        -   Each line of a page MUST contain no more than 71
            characters, followed by a U+000A LINE FEED Unicode
            character. This makes the maximum length of a line 72
            Unicode characters.

        -   U+0020 SPACE characters cannot end a line.

        -   The first line of a page MUST be blank.

        -   The second line of a page MUST contain the following
            components, in order:

            +   The author of the document, followed by U+0020 SPACE
                characters until its length exactly matches 16
                characters. Authors names longer than 16 characters
                MUST be abbreviated.

            +   A single U+0020 SPACE character.

            +   The document identifier (seven characters; see §02-B).

            +   A single U+0020 SPACE character, followed by a U+003A
                COLON character, followed by another U+0020 SPACE
                character.

            +   The title of the document, followed by U+0020 SPACE
                characters until its length exactly matches 40
                characters. This SHOULD be represented in uppercase.



WD-0001                                                             006

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

LANGDEV          WD-0001 : LEXISML STANDARDS DOCUMENTS              007


            +   A single U+0020 SPACE character.

            +   The page number, preceeded by zeroes such that its
                length is exactly 03 characters. LSDOCs of greater than
                999 pages MUST be split into multiple documents.

        -   The third and fourth lines of a page MUST be blank.

        -   Lines 46 and 47 of a page MUST be blank.

        -   Line 48 MUST contain the following components, in order:

            +   The document identifier (seven characters; see 02-B).

            +   Exactly 61 U+0020 SPACE characters.

            +   The page number, preceeded by zeroes such that its
                length is exactly three characters. LSDOCs of greater
                than 999 pages MUST be split into multiple documents.

        -   Line 49 MUST be blank.

        -   Line 50 MUST contain exactly 71 U+0025 PERCENT SIGN
            characters.


    02-B.   Document identifiers

    Document identifiers are 07-character codes which uniquely identify
    the LSDOC. They are constructed as follows:

    -   The first two characters indicate the current document status.
        The document statuses permitted by this document are:

        Working Draft (WD) : This document is currently under
            construction, and can be expected to change at any time.

        Release Candidate (RC) : This document is not expected to
            change significantly before final approval, but might
            contain small errors or bugs.



WD-0001                                                             007

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

LANGDEV          WD-0001 : LEXISML STANDARDS DOCUMENTS              008


        Final Recommendation (FR) : This document is in its final form
            and MUST NOT undergo changes, except through errata (see
            below).

        Errata (E_) : This document is a formal modification to an
            LSDOC with Final Recommendation status. The underscore
            should be replaced with a letter (A--Z) to identify the
            errata. Errata MUST NOT undergo changes after publication;
            however, errata MAY modify previous errata. A new document
            SHOULD be written to supersede an LSDOC with a substantial
            number of errata.

    -   The third character MUST be U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS.

    -   Characters 04--07 MUST be digits (0--9) uniquely identifying
        the document. These MUST be unique across various statuses;
        that is, WD-0009, RC-0009, and FR-0009 refer to different
        drafts of the same document, and EB-0009 refers to FR-0009's
        second errata.


    02-C.   Opening contents

    An LSDOC MUST begin with the following contents, in order:

    -   A title, centred. Titles MUST NOT exceed 59 characters, and
        MUST be on their own line. Titles SHOULD be represented in
        title case.

    -   (OPTIONAL) A subtitle, centred. Subtitles SHOULD be represented
        in sentence case, with the first letter capitalized. Subtitles
        SHOULD begin on the line immediately following a title, and MAY
        take up multiple lines.

    -   The author of the document, centred. A blank line SHOULD be
        placed between the title/subtitle and the author of the
        document. Information, including contact information, MAY be
        placed on the lines immediately following the author's name;
        there SHOULD NOT be a blank line before or within any such
        content.



WD-0001                                                             008

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

LANGDEV          WD-0001 : LEXISML STANDARDS DOCUMENTS              009


        Multiple authors MAY be included; there SHOULD be a blank line
        in-between each.

    -   The following sections, with unnumbered seaction headings:

        +   (OPTIONAL) An abstract.

        +   A "Status of This Document" section. This SHOULD contain a
            textual description of the document status  designated by
            the document identifier (see §02-B) and the date of
            publication. Other pertinent information related to the
            status of the document may also be included here.

        +   A copyright notice.

        +   (RECOMMENDED) In documents with more than one numbered
            section heading, a table of contents.


    02-D.  Sections, headings, and the table of contents

        A section SHOULD be used to group together thematic content,
        and SHOULD be described by a section heading, defined below.
        The contents of a section MUST be indented from section's
        heading, if present.

        Section headings MUST describe a section. Section headings
        MAY be contained by another section, in which case they
        describe a subsection. Any sequence of lines which meets the
        requirements for section headings described in this document
        MUST be considered a section heading.

        Section headings MUST NOT contain a blank line, and non-initial
        lines in a section heading MUST be indented from the initial
        line. Section headings which do not describe subsections SHOULD
        be in title case; all other section headings SHOULD be in
        sentence case.





WD-0001                                                             009

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

LANGDEV          WD-0001 : LEXISML STANDARDS DOCUMENTS              010


        Numbered section headings which are not subheadings SHOULD
        begin a page. Other section headings which do not begin a page
        SHOULD be preceeded by two blank lines. Section headings SHOULD
        be followed by a blank line.

        Sections may consist of only a section heading, but this is NOT
        RECOMMENDED.

        A numbered section heading is comprised of the following:

        -   A section number. This consists of:

            +   In the case of subsections, the section number of
                the smallest section which contains the subsection,
                followed by U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS.

            +   One or more characters in one of the following
                ranges, equivalent to the number of preceeding
                siblings plus one:

                =   For sections which are not subsections, a
                    two-digit number in the range 01--99.

                =   For subsections which are contained in exactly
                    one section, an uppercase letter in the range
                    A--Z.

                =   For subsections which are contained in an even
                    number of sections (greater than zero), a
                    lowercase letter in the range a--z.

                =   For subsections which are contained in an odd
                    number of sections (greater than one) a
                    single-digit number in the range 1--9.

                If the number of preceeding siblings causes one of
                the ranges above to be exhausted, sections SHOULD
                be regrouped to avoid such a problem.





WD-0001                                                             010

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

LANGDEV          WD-0001 : LEXISML STANDARDS DOCUMENTS              011


        -   One U+002E FULL STOP, followed by exactly three U+0020
            SPACE characters.

        -   The section title. This SHOULD NOT be ended by a U+003A
            COLON.

        An unnumbered section heading MUST end with a U+003A COLON. Any
        sequence of lines which is not a numbered section heading,
        meets the other requirements for a section heading, and is
        ended by a U+003A COLON is an unnumbered section heading.

        The table of contents for an LSDOC (see §02-C) MUST be a
        sequence of lines containing the contents of each numbered
        section heading, in order, one per line, with matching
        indentation. Blank lines MAY be inserted between headings for
        readability purposes.


    02-E.   Paragraphs

        Paragraphs SHOULD be separated from other paragraphs by a blank
        line. All lines in a paragraph SHOULD have matching
        indentation, except where otherwise specified in this document.
        Paragraphs MAY NOT contain blank lines.

        A paragraph of quoted material SHOULD be indented from the
        surrounding text.


    02-F.   Lists

        Any sequence of lines matching the following description MUST
        be considered a list item, and any sequence of list items MUST
        be considered a list.

        The indented contents of the first line of a list item MUST
        begin with a single character, which SHOULD be that in the
        following sequence which corresponds with the number of lists
        containing the list item in question: U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS,
        U+002B PLUS SIGN, U+003D EQUALS SIGN, U+2021 DOUBLE DAGGER.
        For example, an item contained in only one list SHOULD use
        U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, but an item contained in a list which is


WD-0001                                                             011

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

LANGDEV          WD-0001 : LEXISML STANDARDS DOCUMENTS              012


        contained in another list which is contianed in yet another
        list SHOULD use U+003D EQUALS SIGN. If this sequence of
        characters be exhausted, it SHOULD be cycled through again; for
        example, an item which is contained in six lists simultaneously
        SHOULD also use U+002B PLUS.

        This character MUST be followed by exactly three U+0020 SPACE
        characters. Non-initial lines in a list item SHOULD be indented
        from the initial line. List items MAY be preceeded or followed
        by blank lines. List items MAY contain one or more paragraphs;
        a paragraph which begins a list item should still be formatted
        according to this section. Paragraphs which do not begin a list
        item should be indented from the list item's initial line.


    02-G.   Dictionaries

        Any sequence of lines matching the following description MUST
        be considered a dictionary item, and any sequence of list items
        MUST be considered a dictionary.

        Dictionary items MUST begin with the following, in order:

        -   Zero or more U+0020 SPACE characters, as necessary for
            proper indentation.

        -   A sequence of characters which does not include the
            sequence U+0020 SPACE, U+003A COLON, U+0020 SPACE. This
            SHOULD be interpreted as the term being defined.

        -   The character sequence U+0020 SPACE, U+003A COLON, U+0020
            SPACE.

        -   A sequence of characters and U+000A LINE FEED Unicode
            characters, at least one of which is a non-space character.
            This SHOULD be interpreted as the term's definition.

        Non-initial lines in a dictionary item SHOULD be indented from
        the initial line. Dictionary items MAY contain one or more
        paragraphs; a paragraph which begins a dictionary item should
        still be formatted according to this section. Paragraphs which

        do not begin a dictionary item should be indented from the
        dictionary item's initial line.

        Dictionaries MAY be contained in list items, but SHOULD NOT
        begin them. Similarly, dictionary items MAY contain lists, but
        these SHOULD be preceeded by at least one U+000A LINE FEED
        Unicode character.


    02-H.   Inline formatting


        Reference citations SHOULD be placed inside square brackets
        ("[]"). URIs SHOULD be placed inside angle brackets ("<>").

        Two U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS characters SHOULD be used instead of an
        en-dash, and three U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS characters SHOULD be
        used instead of an em-dash.

        Important text SHOULD be represented in uppercase. Sections
        SHOULD be referenced by section number, preceeded by U+00A7
        SECTION SIGN.

        Single-digit numbers represented using the digits 0--9 SHOULD
        be preceeded by a zero such that they are two characters long;
        the digits 0--9 SHOULD appear alone only when they are used
        to refer to their respective characters. This recommendation
        MAY be disregarded in the case of mathematical equations or
        other situations where brevity is important.


    02-I.   Other considerations

        Orphan lines (lines which end a paragraph but begin a page, or
        vice versa) SHOULD be avoided. This might require ending a page
        with more blank lines than would otherwise be necessary.

        Words SHOULD NOT be broken up across multiple lines by use of
        hyphenation. U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS characters MAY end a line
        in other circumstances, however (for example, in hyphenated
        words or in URIs).
