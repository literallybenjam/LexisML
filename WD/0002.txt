01.   Introduction

    The LexisML Index Record (LREC) serves to index the lexicon of a
    language and provide links to word definitions. LRECs are designed
    to be minimalist text files that can store a large number of
    records in a compact, human-readable format. The purpose of an LREC
    is to give users and programs a sense of the scope of a lexicon
    without having to encode each individual entry, thus reducing
    initial load times for displaying an index thereof.

    The format of a LREC is based upon that of the IANA Language Subtag
    Registry, which is in turn derived from the record-jar format
    described in [ART-UNIX].

    01-A.   Definitions

        Begin : Of a sequence of lines or characters, to be first in an
            sequence's contents.

        Blank line : A line which contains zero characters; that is,
            a single U+000A LINE FEED Unicode character.

        Character : When not qualified as a Unicode character, a
            graphic character, as defined in [UNICODE].

        Contents : Of a line, the sequence of zero or more characters
            which comprise the line. Of another sequence, the sequence
            itself. A sequence of characters or lines is said to be
            "contained" in another sequence if it is in the sequence's
            contents.

        End : Of a sequence of characters, to be last in an sequence's
            contents. Of a sequence of lines, to be the last lines in
            an sequence's contents which are not blank.

        Field : A sequence of lines as defined in §02.

        Line : A sequence of zero or more characters terminated by a
            U+000A LINE FEED Unicode character.

        LREC : A file which conforms to this specification.

        Non-space character : A character which is not U+0020 SPACE.

        Record : A collection of lines as defined in §02.

        Unicode character : A Unicode scalar value, as defined in
            [UNICODE].

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
        "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in [RFC-2119].

02.   The LREC Format

    LRECs are plain-text files, encoded in UTF-8 as specified by
    [UNICODE]. They consist of several records which, in turn, consist
    of several key-value pairs known as 'fields'.

    A field matches the definition of a dictionary item in [WD-0001],
    with the additional stipulation that blank lines MUST NOT appear in
    or between fields. The characters preceeding the first appearance
    of the character sequence U+0020 SPACE, U+003A COLON, U+0020 SPACE,
    discounting any leading or trailing U+0020 SPACE characters, make
    up the 'field name'. The characters following this sequence,
    similarly discarding leading or trailing U+0020 SPACE characters,
    make up the 'field value'.

    A 'record' is a sequence of fields. Blank lines MUST NOT appear in
    or around records. The character sequence U+0025 PERCENT SIGN,
    U+0025 PERCENT SIGN, on its own line, MUST separate records. Other
    Unicode characters MUST NOT appear in-between, before, or after
    records.

    Fields are referred to by their field names. Except where otherwise
    specified, more than one field of a particular field name MUST NOT
    appear in a single record. All fields which are not marked as
    OPTIONAL or RECOMMENDED are REQUIRED to appear in a record's
    contents. Except where otherwise specified, field names are case-
    insensitive but field values are case-sensitive.


    02-A.   Record and field definitions


        02-A-a.   Metadata records

            A metadata record MUST begin a LREC, and MUST NOT appear
            elsewhere in the document. It consists of the following
            fields, in any order, specified by their field names:

            Title : The title of the LDOC.

            Subtitle : (OPTIONAL) The subtitle of the LDOC.


WD-0002                                                             005

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

            Author : (RECOMMENDED) The author(s) of the LDOC.

            Date : (RECOMMENDED) The date upon which the LDOC was last
                modified. The field-value of a date field SHOULD be in
                the "full-date" format as specified by [RFC3339].

            Language : (RECOMMENDED) A language tag matching the syntax
                provided in [BCP47], describing the language of the
                LDOC as a whole; ie., that of its intended audience.
                This SHOULD be a valid (recognized) tag.

            Description : (RECOMMENDED) A description of the scope and
                purpose of the LDOC, or similar relevant information.

            Splash : (OPTIONAL) Splash text; that is, miscellaneous
                words and phrases used to celebrate different aspects
                or achievements of the document. This field MAY appear
                more than once.

            Frontmatter : (OPTIONAL) A URI at which the frontmatter for
                the dictionary may be retrieved, if available.

            Note : (OPTIONAL) A note or comment on the LDOC as a whole.
                This field MAY appear more than once.


        02-A-b.   Tag-group records

            A tag-group record groups together the tags which MAY
            appear in lexeme records. If present, tag-group records
            MUST appear before any lexeme records. They consist of the
            following fields, in any order, specified by their field
            names:

            Group : The name of the tag-group. This MUST be unique
                across an LDOC; ie., there must not be more than one
                tag-group record with a given group field.

            Description : (OPTIONAL) A description of the tag-group.
                The field value of this field is case-insensitive.



WD-0002                                                             006

            Subgroup : (OPTIONAL) The name of another tag-group which
                should be considered a part of this one. This field MAY
                appear more than once. The field value of this field is
                case-insensitive.

            Tag : (OPTIONAL) The name of a tag which should be
                considered a part of this tag-group. This field MAY
                appear more than once. The field value of this field is
                case-insensitive.

            Note : (OPTIONAL) A note or comment on the tag group. This
                field MAY appear more than once.

            Although both tag and subgroup fields are OPTIONAL, at
            least one of these fields MUST appear in a tag-group
            record. Furthermore, both fields MUST be unique across an
            LDOC; that is, any two tag or subgroup fields MUST NOT have
            the same field value when compared in a case-insensitive
            manner, regardless of the record they are contained in.


        02-A-c.   Lexeme records

            A lexeme record provides information on a lexeme. It
            consists of the following fields, in any order, specified
            by their field names:

            Lexeme : The lexeme itself. This MUST be unique across an
                LDOC; ie., there must not be more than one lexeme
                record with a given lexeme field.

            At : A URI at which information on the lexeme can be
                retrieved.

            Language : (RECOMMENDED) A language tag matching
                the syntax provided in [BCP47], describing the language
                of the lexeme itself. If this field is absent but the
                document language field is present in the LDOC's
                metadata record, the language of the lexeme should be
                inherited from the language of the LDOC as a whole.



WD-0002                                                             007

            Pronunciation : (RECOMMENDED) A hint at pronouncing the
                lexeme.

            Tagged : (OPTIONAL) A tag providing more information about
                a lexeme. This field MAY appear more than once. The
                field value of this field is case-insensitive.

            Note : (OPTIONAL) A note or comment on the lexeme record.
                This field MAY appear more than once.


        02-A-d.   Inflection records

            An inflection record provides inflected forms for lexemes.
            It consists of the following fields, in any order,
            specified by their field names:

            Inflected : The inflected form.

            Of : The lexeme that the record provides an inflection of.
                This MUST match the lexeme field of a lexeme record,
                which MUST appear before a given record.

            Pronunciation : (RECOMMENDED) A hint at pronouncing the
                inflected form.

            Note : (OPTIONAL) A note or comment on the inflection. This
                field MAY appear more than once.

            Any two inflection records in a single LDOC MUST NOT have
            identical values for both the inflected and of fields.


        02-A-e.   Alternate records

            An alternate record provides alternate forms for lexemes
            or inflections. It consists of the following fields, in any
            order, specified by their field names:

            Alternate : The alternate form.



WD-0002                                                             008

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

LANGDEV          WD-0002 : LEXISML INDEX RECORDS                    009


            For : The lexeme or inflection that the record provides an
                alternate for. This MUST match the lexeme field of a
                lexeme record or the inflected field of an inflection
                record, either of which MUST appear before the given
                alternate record.

            Of : (OPTIONAL) If the for field refers to an inflection,
                this field MUST match the of field of the corresponding
                inflection record.

            Script : (OPTIONAL) A script tag as specified in [BCP47],
                describing the script that the alternate form is
                written in. If left unspecified, the script is assumed
                to be the same as the lexeme that the record provides
                an alternate for.

            Pronunciation : (OPTIONAL) If the pronunciation of the
                alternate differs from the original lexeme, a hint at
                its pronunciation.

            Note : (OPTIONAL) A note or comment on the alternate. This
                field MAY appear more than once.

            Any two alternate records in a single LDOC MUST NOT have
            identical values for both the alternate and for fields,
            when both records provide an alternate form for a lexeme,
            or identical values for all three of the alternate, for,
            and of fields, when both records provide an alternate form
            for an inflection.


        02-A-f.   Comment records

            A comment record inserts a comment into a document. It
            consists of only one field:

            Note : (REQUIRED) A note or comment. This field MAY appear
                more than once.
