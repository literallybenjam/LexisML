01.   Introduction

    The LexisML Index Record (LREC) serves to index the lexicon of a
    language and provide links to word definitions. LRECs are designed
    to be minimalist text files that can store a large number of
    records in a compact, human-readable format. The purpose of an LREC
    is to give users and programs a sense of the scope of a lexicon
    without having to encode each individual entry, thus reducing
    initial load times for displaying an index thereof.

    The format of a LREC is based upon that of the IANA Language Subtag
    Registry, which is in turn derived from the record-jar format
    described in [ART-UNIX].

    01-A.   Definitions

        Begin : Of a sequence of lines or characters, to be first in an
            sequence's contents.

        Blank line : A line which contains zero characters; that is,
            a single U+000A LINE FEED Unicode character.

        Character : When not qualified as a Unicode character, a
            graphic character, as defined in [UNICODE].

        Contents : Of a line, the sequence of zero or more characters
            which comprise the line. Of another sequence, the sequence
            itself. A sequence of characters or lines is said to be
            "contained" in another sequence if it is in the sequence's
            contents.

        End : Of a sequence of characters, to be last in an sequence's
            contents. Of a sequence of lines, to be the last lines in
            an sequence's contents which are not blank.

        Field : A sequence of lines as defined in ยง02.

        Line : A sequence of zero or more characters terminated by a
            U+000A LINE FEED Unicode character.

        LREC : A file which conforms to this specification.

        Non-space character : A character which is not U+0020 SPACE.

        Record : A collection of lines as defined in ยง02.

        Unicode character : A Unicode scalar value, as defined in
            [UNICODE].

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
        "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in [RFC-2119].

02.   The LREC Format

    LRECs are plain-text files, encoded in UTF-8 as specified by
    [UNICODE]. They consist of several records which, in turn, consist
    of several key-value pairs known as 'fields'.

    A field matches the definition of a dictionary item in [WD-0001],
    with the additional stipulation that blank lines MUST NOT appear in
    or between fields. The characters preceeding the first appearance
    of the character sequence U+0020 SPACE, U+003A COLON, U+0020 SPACE,
    discounting any leading or trailing U+0020 SPACE characters, make
    up the 'field name'. The characters following this sequence,
    similarly discarding leading or trailing U+0020 SPACE characters,
    make up the 'field value'.

    A 'record' is a sequence of fields. Blank lines MUST NOT appear in
    or around records. The character sequence U+0025 PERCENT SIGN,
    U+0025 PERCENT SIGN, on its own line, MUST separate records. Other
    Unicode characters MUST NOT appear in-between, before, or after
    records.

    Fields are referred to by their field names. Except where otherwise
    specified, more than one field of a particular field name MUST NOT
    appear in a single record. All fields which are not marked as
    OPTIONAL or RECOMMENDED are REQUIRED to appear in a record's
    contents. Except where otherwise specified, field names are case-
    insensitive but field values are case-sensitive.


    02-A.   Record and field definitions


        02-A-a.   Metadata records

            A metadata record MUST begin a LREC, and MUST NOT appear
            elsewhere in the document. It consists of the following
            fields, in any order, specified by their field names:

            Title : The title of the LDOC.

            Subtitle : (OPTIONAL) The subtitle of the LDOC.


WD-0002                                                             004

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

LANGDEV          WD-0002 : LEXISML INDEX RECORDS                    005


            Author : (RECOMMENDED) The author(s) of the LDOC.

            Date : (RECOMMENDED) The date upon which the LDOC was last
                modified. The field-value of a date field SHOULD be in
                the "full-date" format as specified by [RFC3339].

            Document language : (RECOMMENDED) A language tag matching
                the syntax provided in [BCP47], describing the language
                of the LDOC as a whole; ie., that of its intended
                audience. This SHOULD be a valid (recognized) tag.

            Description : (RECOMMENDED) A description of the scope and
                purpose of the LDOC, or similar relevant information.

            Splash : (OPTIONAL) Splash text; that is, miscellaneous
                words and phrases used to celebrate different aspects
                or achievements of the document. This field MAY appear
                more than once.

            Commentary : (OPTIONAL) A comment on the LDOC as a whole.

        02-A-b.   Tag-group records

            A tag-group record groups together the tags which MAY
            appear in lexeme records. If present, tag-group records
            MUST appear before any lexeme records. They consist of the
            following fields, in any order, specified by their field
            names:

            Name : The name of the tag-group.

            Description : (OPTIONAL) A description of the tag-group.

            Subgroup : (OPTIONAL) The name of another tag-group which
                should be considered a part of this one. This field MAY
                appear more than once.

            Tag : (OPTIONAL) The name of a tag which should be
                considered a part of this tag-group. This field MAY
                appear more than once.



WD-0002                                                             005

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

LANGDEV          WD-0002 : LEXISML INDEX RECORDS                    006


            Although both tag and subgroup fields are OPTIONAL, at
            least one of these fields MUST appear in a tag-group
            record. Furthermore, both fields MUST be unique across an
            LDOC; that is, any two tag or subgroup fields MUST NOT have
            the same field value, regardless of the record they are
            contained in.

        02-A-c.   Lexeme records

            A lexeme record provides information on a lexeme. It
            consists of the following fields, in any order, specified
            by their field names:

            Lexeme : The lexeme itself.

            At : A URI at which information on the lexeme can be
                retrieved.

            Language : (RECOMMENDED) A language tag matching
                the syntax provided in [BCP47], describing the language
                of the lexeme itself. If this field is absent but the
                document language field is present in the LDOC's
                metadata record, the language of the lexeme should be
                inherited from the language of the LDOC as a whole.

            Pronunciation : (RECOMMENDED) A hint at pronouncing the
                lexeme.

            Tagged : (OPTIONAL) A tag providing more information about
                a lexeme. This field MAY appear more than once.

            Note : (OPTIONAL) A note or comment on the lexeme record.
